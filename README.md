This repository is a collection of simple USD projects. Each project
shows off a single feature or group of USD features.


## Structure summary

This repository is split into six categories

- Features
- Concepts
- Tricks
- Plugins
- Tools
- References

**Features** highlight a single class or set of functions for working in USD.

**Concepts** take features explained in Features and extends them to real-world examples.

**Tricks** are simple, isolated ideas using USD Features.

**Plugins** show how to customize USD to suit your pipeline.

**Tools** are miscellaneous scripts that are built to do a specific task, with USD.

**References** are useful pages for finding more information about USD and how to interact with it in your projects.

Every project in this repository will show how to work in Python, C++,
and USDA wherever possible.


## How to view
If a concept folder is trying to show off a USD feature but it takes a
lot of code then the top-level README.md file is there to summarize the
important bits. It may also refer to other resources for where to read
more.

Lastly, source-code files may contain explanations for what is shown.
Each of these lines is marked with `XXX`.


## How to build
### C++
Unless a C++ project has specific instructions, every project compiles
and executes using the following commands:

```bash
cd {some_concept_cpp_folder}/build
USD_INSTALL_ROOT=/wherever/you/installed/USD/to cmake ..
make
./run_it
```

`USD_INSTALL_ROOT` typically defaults to `/usr/local/USD`
on Linux but your location may vary.
See [USD's build documentation](https://github.com/PixarAnimationStudios/USD#3-run-the-script) for details.


### Python
Python modules can always run using `python name_of_module.py`

## Roadmap
See [This wiki page](https://github.com/ColinKennedy/USD-Cookbook/wiki)
for a list of planned topics that will be added in the future.


## Contributing
This repository is a constant WIP. If there's something that you'd like
to see written about, please suggest it as an issue so that I / others
can pick it up and work on it. Also, if you have something that you'd
like to contribute, please make a PR. Submissions are welcome!


## Disclaimer
But note: This repository may not actually show the best way to do
things in USD. It's just a collection of (my) personal findings. Also,
as Pixar comes out with new USD releases and learning resources, this
information may become out-of-date. Always prefer primary guides and
documentation over anything that you see here.


## Final Note
Tested with:
- CentOS 7.6
- USD 19.07
- cmake version 3.13.4
- make 3.82
- g++ 8.3.0
